You are building a new admin management page in a React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS app (Next.js App Router).

Follow this exact style and architecture from the existing YearsManagement page:

1. **Global Theme System**  
   - The app already has a ThemeProvider with 'light' | 'dark' | 'system' support.  
   - It adds/removes the 'dark' class on <html> and persists in localStorage.  
   - DO NOT add any local dark mode state or theme toggle button — theme is controlled globally from the navbar.

2. **API Integration**  
   - Use the existing centralized Axios instance (imported as import api from './axios'; ') which automatically adds Bearer token from localStorage.  
   - Create a reusable API file: src/components/api/[feature].ts       
   - Import and use those functions in the component.  
   - Handle errors gracefully: show user-friendly messages from err.response?.data?.detail if available.

3. **UI/Design Requirements**  
   - Overall layout: full-height page with light gray background in light mode (bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900)  
   - Header: white/dark card with bottom border and shadow, containing only the page title (text-3xl font-bold)  
   - Max width container: max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6  
   - Cards: rounded-xl shadow-lg bg-white dark:bg-gray-800  
   - Form inputs: clean, rounded, with proper dark mode borders and background  
   - Buttons: blue primary (bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700), red for destructive actions  
   - List items: hover effects (hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-700/50), divided by borders  
   - Success/current indicators: green badge with check icon  
   - Error messages: red alert box with border  
   - Use lucide-react icons consistently  
   - Responsive: flex-col on mobile, flex-row on larger screens where needed

4. **Component Structure Example to Follow**
   - useState for data, loading, error, form fields
   - useEffect to load data on mount
   - Separate handlers for create/update/delete/set-status
   - Confirmation dialog for destructive actions (window.confirm is fine)
   - Show loading state on submit buttons
   - Display current/active item clearly at bottom if relevant

5. **Tailwind Classes to Reuse**
   - Text: text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100
   - Borders: border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700
   - Hover: hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-700/50
   - Inputs: border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 bg-white dark:bg-gray-700
   - Focus ring: focus:ring-4 focus:ring-blue-500/30

Task: Build a [PAGE NAME] management page (e.g., Departments, Classes, Subjects, etc.) with:
- List all items
- Add new item
- Full dark/light mode support via existing theme system

Make sure the design, spacing, typography, and behavior feel identical to the Year Management page.
